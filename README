A fresh configuration of Emacs, with the goal of being as portable and modular
as possible.

If you'd like to try this configuration, install Cask[1], a package manager for
Emacs. Then delete your `~/.emacs.d/` directory (if it exists) and run these
commands:

    git clone https://www.github.com/williamyao/emacs-configuration.git ~/.emacs.d
    cd ~/.emacs.d
    git checkout dyntu
    cask install
