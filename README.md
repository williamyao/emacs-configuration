#.emacs.d

My `.emacs.d` directory, or enough of it to setup a fresh install, at least.

Depends on the [Cask](https://cask.readthedocs.org/) package management system.

##Installing

First install [Cask](https://cask.readthedocs.org/), if you haven't already.

```
cd 
&& git clone https://www.github.com/williamyao/emacs-configuration.git .emacs.d/
&& cd .emacs.d/
&& cask install
```

Happy hacking!
